- Normalization (Color)
- Size standardization
- Data augmentation
- Tensor conversion (torch)

- Model deployment
- Scripts tracking


- Classic base model (CrossEntopy) after data augmentation, then focalLoss and other to penalize unbalance (Or CrossEntropy with greater weight for minority classes)

TransferLearning (Remove last layer and adapt) Then test unfreezing
